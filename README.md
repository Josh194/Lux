# Lux
A simple, but versatile digital synthesizer.
Uses AVX instructions to speed up computation.

**Note: Development of this project has ended; It had to be quickly finished due to deadlines, and wasn't built to last. Due to this, the project works, but is buggy (To be specific, the app suffers from extreme memory corruption, which seems to be caused by the audio library being used), has many advanced features that don't work, and has shaky foundations), and is missing many features I wanted to include. The project will no longer be updated, but a new version is being worked on.**
